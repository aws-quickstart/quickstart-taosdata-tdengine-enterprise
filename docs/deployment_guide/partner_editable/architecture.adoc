As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
//TODO Troy, I reworded this because the original wording was "... bucket to server tired-storage...". Please confirm that it's correct.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for server-tiered storage (supported in TDengine Enterprise Edition only).*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
//TODO Troy, should this say "instances" instead of "nodes"? The icon in the diagram for "Dnodes" is the resource icon for "Instances".
** The TDengine cluster nodes that span two Availability Zones in an Auto Scaling group for scaling flexibility.
** A network load balancer that passes RESTful requests to the group of data nodes.
** An ElastiCache for Redis replication group with primary and replica nodes.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
