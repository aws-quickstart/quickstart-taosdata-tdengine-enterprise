== Predeployment steps

To start the workshop, you must have an AWS account. If you do not have an account, sign up for one at https://aws.amazon.com/free/[Amazon Free Tier^]. Generate an Amazon EC2 key pair for the AWS Region the solution is deployed in.

If you deploy in an existing VPC, verify you set up the NAT gateway, including NAT resource, NATEIP, and RouteNATGateway. Otherwise, the cluster doesn't run as expected.
