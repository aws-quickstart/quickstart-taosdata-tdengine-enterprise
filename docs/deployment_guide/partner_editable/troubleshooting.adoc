*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Partner Solution.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and instances remain running so you can troubleshoot the issue.

IMPORTANT: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Partner Solution templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, or from a location other than Amazon S3, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* Dnodes hasn't been launched.

//TODO Troy, I reworded this sentence because it didn't make sense as it was. Please confirm it's correct.*A.* We recommend you don't use SSH to access Amazon EC2 instances while the Amazon EC2 status is *initializing*.

*Q.* How to deploy in the China Region.

*A.* The China Region uses the same templates.
